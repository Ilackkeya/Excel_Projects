Challenge 1:

The first task is to write a formula in column C that extracts the region code from the ‘Ref’ column.

The region code is the three digits in the middle of the reference.

With this task complete, we then need to do some sales analysis. 

We need to return the total sales for each region, and also calculate how many sales met or exceeded the target value of 2,500.

Then, create a clean and easy to understand column chart of the sales by region data.

You can make any changes that you feel necessary for the chart.

My solution:

Used MID formula to extract the Region value from the string

Used SUMIFS to calculate region wise sales

Used COUNTIFS to calculate the count of sales met or exceeded the target value of 2,500

Used Bar Chart to plot the Total Sales by Region

Challenge 2: 

You have received a file with resolved issues data.

It contains the following columns:

The area from which the issue was received
A combined column with the name of the person assigned to the issue and the issue date
The priority level of the issue
The number of days that it took to resolve the issue

Unfortunately the data is not in a format that makes it easy to analyze.

There are various problems such as:

The area code is in a row on its own
The name and date is in a combined column and requires separating
Some of the names have the incorrect case
There are average rows and blank rows under each area which we do not need
The challenge is to use Power Query to transform this data into a format that we can analyze easily.

And then answer a couple of questions about the data.

We want to know:

1. The average response time in days

2. The number of level 1 or level 2 issues that were resolved in less than 5 days

My Solution:

Used Power Query editor to format the columns as directed

Used AVERAGE function to calculate the average of response in days

Used COUNTIFS to calculate the No of Level 1 & 2 priority with responses < 5 days

Challenge 3:

The sales-report.xlsx workbook is the one to work from. And the goal of this challenge is to create the following two Pivot Tables

In a workbook named sales-data.xlsx, there are three tables named North_Sales, South_Sales and East_Sales.

We need to import these three tables into sales-report.xlsx and stack them into one list. These are the only three tables we want from that workbook. Exclude everything else.

We then need to combine the two tables to get the product ‘Name’ and ‘Category’ columns into the stacked sales table.

We also need to add a column with the region name (taken from the table name) and also a conditional column with the sales grouped into the following categories: 0-49, 50-99, 100-199 and 200+.

Consider that additional sales tables may be added in the future, such as West_Sales, and the solution should continue to work with this new data when clicking Refresh.

The Pivot Tables can then be created from this sales table.

My Solution:

Used Power Query editor to import the data files needed for the analysis

Created a new column named 'Region' in all the South_Sales, North_Sales and East_Sales files before appending them into one file.

Merged the Product table and appended table using Left Join with Product Code column. Removed columns not needed for the analysis.

Created a new column named 'Order Size' to categorize the sales into different groups.

Closed and Loaded the transformed data to create Pivot table.

Created 2 Pivot table as instructed from the transformed table summarizing the sales across each category and across different months.


Challenge 4:

These are some of the tasks you will need to accomplish to get to the final solution.

Produce a query/table which only includes the students who took both tests. For this example, the students are uniquely identified by using both their first and last names.
Create a column in the format last name, first name instead of the two name columns.
Calculate the age in years of each student.
Fix the Date Joined column which is currently not recognized as a date.
Include columns for both test scores and create an additional column with the total of both.
Create a column that displays “Pass” if they achieve a total score of 140 or higher, and “Fail” if they do not.

My Solution:

Launched Power Query Editor and create merge queries to include only students who took both tests using "INNER" join. 

Used Create Column from Example option to create the name in the requested format.

Calculated age using Duration and rounding down features.

Fixed the Date Joined column using Column from Example feature and changed the data type to date.

Created new column to calculate test scores.

Used if statement to create Pass/Fail column using the given condition.


Challenge 5:

This challenge consists of 12 different Excel formula problems that require fixing. Each problem is on a different worksheet.

Some formulas are returning incorrect results and others are returning error messages, but why? Do you have what it takes to solve this challenge? 🕵️

This is a useful ‘real world’ challenge for those learning Excel. Formulas do not always go to plan, and we need the skills to fix issues that arise.

If you are already an advanced Excel user, maybe this will not be much of a problem. However, it is good to exercise your formula muscles regularly.

If you do consider yourself an Excel expert, take the difficulty level up a notch by timing yourself to see how quickly you can fix all 12 problems.


My Solution:

Documented in Excel

Challenge 6:

Here’s the scenario to be solved from the download file:

It’s coming up to the end of the year and there’s a scramble to take vacation days. 

The HR Department wants to prioritize who gets to take vacation first by looking at employee tenure and the number of vacation days each employee has remaining.

If an employee has more than five vacation days remaining, or if they’ve been with the company for three years or more, they’ll get priority. 

Write a formula where the cells in column E will say “Priority” if at least one of these two conditions is met. If neither condition is met, we want this column to display a blank.

HR also wants to query the number of vacation days remaining per department. 

Write a formula in cell B17 which will calculate and display the number of vacation days based on the department selected from the B16 dropdown cell.

My Solution:

Used IF formula and OR function to calculate the request status

Used SUMIF to calculate remaining vacation days for each department


Challenge 7: 

The bookstore on the corner has their book database entered in an Excel workbook table. The store owner wants to be able to query a Book ID and extract that entire row from the database.

She also wants to minimize input errors by having employees select the Book ID from a dropdown list in cell A2. She knows how to create dropdown lists, but is having trouble setting up one which expands or contracts dynamically as books are added and removed from the database. 

Once you’ve helped her with that, write a formula in row 5 that uses the selected Book ID to pull the correct row from the Database.

My Solution:

Created Dropdown list from Data validation and used XLOOKUP to retrieve the book info using Book ID


Challenge 8: 

Here’s how the incentive program works:

Agents can earn a maximum of 5 points per one-month period. 

Attendance percentage is calculated based on the number of days the employee came to work, measured against the number of business days. Agents get 1 point if their attendance is 95 percent or higher, and zero if their attendance is below 95 percent.

Call quality is based on the employee’s quality score as measured by the Quality Assurance Department. Agents get 2 points if they score 100 percent, 1 point if they score between 90 percent and 99 percent, and zero if their call quality is below 90 percent.

Average Daily Sales checks the employee’s total sales against the number of days they came to work. Agents get 2 points if they average 2 or more sales per day, 1 point if they average less than 2 but at least 1 sale, and zero points if their daily sales average is below 1.

On the Incentive worksheet, Column J should have the total points earned, formatted with green icons for 5 points, amber for 4 points, and red for fewer than 4 points. 

Employees with 5 points will get a $100 bonus, and those with 4 points will earn $50.


My Solution:

Mapped the attendance %, call quality, average sales into the Incentive sheet using VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP formulas.
Calculated the points using IF and SUM functions.

Challenge 9: 

The school board has a list of all the schools in the district - from elementary to post-secondary, showing their city or town and population. They got an intern to put all this data together, but he sorted the dataset by the name of the school, which isn’t statistically useful to the Board.

Tasks
1. What they really want is to sort schools alphabetically by town. Each town should have its schools displayed in the following order:

Elementary > Middle > High > Community College > University.
Towns that have more than one of the same school type should list the one with the larger population first.

2. In the cells to the right of the data, we want to determine the occupancy percentage (population vs. capacity) of each type of school. Occupancy levels should be shown from lowest to highest, left to right.


My Solution:

Sorted through custom sort by creating a list and then used SUMIF function to calculate the occupancy %

Challenge 10: 

We need to generate two charts from each worksheet - one which shows the new and returning visits by country, and the other which shows the proportion, or percentage, of paid accounts by country. Your manager didn't tell you what type of charts to create - it’s your job to determine the best chart based on the type of data you will be representing.

You’ve decided that since you will need to do this process every three months, you should just create a macro to do it all in one click each time.

The charts should be on the same page as the data they represent, and they should be formatted with proper labels and titles.

Set up your macro, run it for each quarter and your job is done.


My Solution:
